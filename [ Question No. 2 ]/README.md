Implement the following piecewise recurrence relation in the 3 different ways.
§ Explain the differences (advantages, disadvantages) between the 3.
§ Must be written in C
The problem
F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n -2) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2. Assume that n will be less than or equal to the maximum integer value and non-negative. You only need to write the function(s).
