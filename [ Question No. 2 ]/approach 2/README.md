## Approach 2: Memoization (Top-Down Dynamic Programming)
### Advantages:

Avoids redundant computations by storing previously calculated values in the memoization array.
Improved time complexity compared to the pure recursive approach for larger values of n.
### Disadvantages:

Still has some overhead due to recursive calls.
Requires extra memory for the memoization array.
