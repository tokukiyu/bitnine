## Approach 1: Recursive Function
### Advantages:

Simple and intuitive.
Direct representation of the mathematical definition.
Easy to understand and implement.
### Disadvantages:

High time complexity due to repeated recursive calls, leading to exponential time complexity.
Significant overhead and redundant computations for larger values of n
