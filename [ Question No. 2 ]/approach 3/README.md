## Approach 3: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming (Iterative)
### Advantages:
Efficient and optimal solution in terms of both time and space complexity.
No recursion overhead.
Suitable for calculating F(n) for large values of n.

### Disadvantages:

Requires more code to implement compared to the recursive approaches.
Doesn't have the direct mathematical representation of the recurrence relation as in the recursive approaches.
