## Overview

This C program demonstrates how to construct and evaluate mathematical expressions using a custom AST. It defines various mathematical operations and applies them to evaluate expressions. The program also calculates Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming.

## Development Environment

This program is written in C and can be compiled and run on various platforms. To compile the code, you'll need a C compiler such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Operating System**: Any OS with GCC installed (Linux, macOS, Windows with MinGW, etc.)

## Compilation

Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code (`math_expression_evaluator.c`). Use the following command to compile the code:

```bash
gcc math_expression_evaluator.c -o math_expression_evaluator
```

## Running the Program 

After compiling, you can run the executable file generated:

```
./math_expression_evaluator
```

## Usage

The program constructs an AST to represent mathematical expressions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, absolute value, and Fibonacci numbers. It evaluates the expressions by recursively calculating the value at each node of the AST.

Fibonacci numbers are computed using dynamic programming for efficiency.

## Example Output

```
add : 16  
mul : 20
sub : -4
fibo : 2
```
